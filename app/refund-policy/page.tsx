          <h2>Refunds (if applicable)</h2>
          <p>Once your return is received and inspected, we will send you an email to notify you that we have received your returned item. We will also notify you of the approval or rejection of your refund.</p>
          <p>If you are approved, then your refund will be processed, and a credit will automatically be applied to your credit card or original method of payment, within a certain amount of days.</p>
          <h2>Exchanges (if applicable)</h2>
          <p>We only replace items if they are defective or damaged. If you need to exchange it for the same item, send us an email at support@mc-diamondz.com.</p>
